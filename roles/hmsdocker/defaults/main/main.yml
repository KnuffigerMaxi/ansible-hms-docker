# Options:
#    `local`: local folder path

#    `nfs`: NFS share
hms_docker_media_share_type: local

# Where the media share will be mounted locally // default: "/opt/{{ project_name }}/media_data"

# The name of the library folders that will be created within the library folder that was defined above
#  Valid `type` values are:
#   `movies`
#   `tv_shows`

# The `type` value controls which containers the folders get mounted to (such as `movies` for Radarr, `tv_shows` for Sonarr)
# The `folder_name` is the name of the folder that will be created for that `type` of library
